display_name=IfXpathExists
short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">IF</span> conditional statement looking for node(s) on a web page. | The <i>IfXpathExists</i> statement is one of the <i>HTML transaction</i> conditional statements. It conditionally executes a block of statements, depending on the fulfillment of a condition expression. In other words, if the condition is fulfilled, child statements are executed. <br/>\
The condition is the existence in the current web page of nodes matching the XPath defined through the <b>XPath</b> property. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>IfXpathExists</i> statement is created in a handler, it can be easily replaced by an <i>IfXpathExistsThenElse</i>, using the right-click menu on the statement and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>IfXpathExistsThenElse</b>. The <b>XPath</b> property remains the same and the statements present in the <i>IfXpathExists</i> are moved to the <i>Then</i> sub-statement.
property.condition.display_name=XPath
property.condition.short_description=Defines the XPath expression to test. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as an XPath. <br/>\
The execution of this <b>XPath</b> on the web page DOM is used as a condition in order to decide whether to execute or not the child statements: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">true</span> if one or several nodes are matching the XPath, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">false</span> if no node matches.<br/>
